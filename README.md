# Valorant Language Changer
Changes the text language for valorant while keeping the voice language.

Want to hear those uwu-voices from japan but don't understand anything that is written there? It's your lucky day!

## Usage
1. Change your ingame language to whatever you want the *voice* language to be.
2. Download the latest VLC.zip file from [here](https://github.com/SuspiciousActivity/ValorantLanguageChanger/releases/latest/download/VLC.zip) and unpack it somewhere.
3. Run the start.bat file.
4. Follow the setup and have fun!
5. You can delete the zip and the unpacked files afterwards.

## Is this a virus??
No. This file downloads an additional exe file from [here (github.com)](https://github.com/Morilli/ManifestDownloader) which might be flagged as a virus.  
It is used to download the latest language files from the official Riot Games servers.  
You can have a look at the script's code and the exe's code as well.  
If your antivirus has a problem, you could try to exclude the folder `%localappdata%/ValorantLangChanger/` from your antivirus.

## Thanks to
https://github.com/Morilli/ManifestDownloader this downloads the latest language files!
